Fiat
====

Fiat is a more-or-less direct translation of the randomized alternate world-building procedure laid out in [GURPS Infinite Worlds](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/infiniteworlds/).

All probabilities, descriptions, and names are from there, with a few trivial exceptions. It supports deeper per-country attributes to some extent, but they're not used or filled out yet.

I've put the project on hold, first after trying to implement map support, and eventually to construct a true historical simulator instead.
